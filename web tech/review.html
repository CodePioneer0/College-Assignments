                <p>John's comment: The question paper was challenging but manageable. I appreciated the inclusion of both multiple-choice and long-answer questions, as it allowed me to showcase my analytical skills. However, I felt that some questions were a bit ambiguous, which made it difficult to choose the correct answer. Overall, it was a good experience.</p>
